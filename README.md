# Local library project

This project follows steps on [MDN's Express/Node tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction).

App is deployed on Heroku (PaaS environment) [here](https://heno-local-library.herokuapp.com/ "Heno's local library").

Application uses MVC design pattern, where M stands for _models_, V for _views_ and C for _controllers_.

Models communicate with the database and perform CRUD operations.
Views use template engines and take care of rendering dynamic pages to the user.
Controllers take care of application logic and consume models and views.
